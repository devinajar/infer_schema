# Infer BigQuery from CSV file

### Description
This is a simple project in pandas (python) to retrieve the schema from a CSV file and create a schema definition for a BigQuery table.

The script will remove the curly braces `{}` that are sometimes present in the name of the columns in a CSV file.

### Files
infer_schema.py

### Usage
[Under Development]
Input CSV files as arguments when executing the script.

----
For now, the files have to be harcoded in the python code and the it only needs to be executed as a normal python script.

`python infer_schema.py`
